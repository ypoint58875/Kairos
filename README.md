# Kairos
In an age of emptiness, we haven't lost passion—we've lost our way on where to begin. Kairos is your catalyst. Powered by Google Gemini, it breaks the paralysis of choice with randomized micro-tasks. Each task is a probe into your true self. Through AI, we decode your soul and help you rebuild a world of interests out of the void.
"I’ve just finished the UI for Kairos—an app designed. The vision is clear and the design is ready, but I’m stuck on how to move forward with the backend and global distribution. If you think the concept is cool and want to help me bring this to life, let’s team up!"
